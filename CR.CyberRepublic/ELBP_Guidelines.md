# Elastos Organizer Meetup Planning Guidelines

This document describes the process and guidelines we hope elected/appointed organizers will follow when proposing events,
tasks and new bounties. *At the time of this writing the EBP site is not yet launched*

## Getting Started

1. Read the section below on **Familiarize Yourself With Our Goals**

2. Join the Slack - ask us any questions about our goals so you are sure we're on the same page

3. Add your info to our Github at [Elastos.Community.Global](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Community.Global), make
a folder for your community, add the info and then issue a PR. This is a temporary solution until the EBP site is operational.

4. Submit a Proposal


## Familiarize Yourself With Our Goals

The Elastos community will go through several phases as the platform matures, at the moment with only DID and ELA Pay
our focus is with getting our branding out among seasoned developers who can quickly ramp up and develop future apps
on Elastos or participate in our upcoming hackathon/competition.

Less emphasis will be placed on universities/schools, but any publicity among students is still good as they are likely
places to find many crypto fans. Also investors will be targeted at a later date but always welcome to our events.

Initially the only developer tasks will be building example/demo apps, bug reporting/fixes and writing tutorials.
Therefore we are not immediately looking for engineering teams to build apps on Elastos, the goal is to establish a
relationship with developers looking to learn more about Elastos or get involved.

### Learn about Elastos - we will be putting together a learning package so you can learn the important aspects of Elastos to talk about during the meetups.


### Your goals in a new community for the first 1-2 months should be the following. Your task proposal should be related to one of these goals.

1. **Host a small public meetup targeted towards existing Elastos fans in your community**

    Your first meetup should be small and not require extensive advertising, we want to gauge the existing popularity of
    Elastos in your community.

    Also we hope that you can find assistants to help you through this initial event. We do not
    want anyone to tackle this alone and want to grow faster.

    You should post the meetup online in existing event websites, forums or chat groups (Telegram), suggestions below:

    - set up an online presence in forums
    - look for websites similar to meetup.com
    - look for cryptocurrency/blockchain websites you can advertise your event
    - mention your event in the Elastos Telegram group and your respective country's Telegram group if it exists
    - look for co-working spaces that are geared towards blockchain technologies
    - search for blockchain events/conferences in your community and where they advertise their events

2. **Connect with Established Individuals in your local Blockchain Community**

    Finding the influential members in your community already in the blockchain space is crucial to building partnerships
    and growth in the long run. Elastos is open to organizing events with other blockchains or sponsoring events for
    publicity. We don't want you to do everything yourself, find assistants, make friends and find ways to scale
    the events as much as possible.

3. **Figure out what Promotional Materials you need**

    Please contact us for promotional/marketing materials, you should not undertake developing these yourself. Online
    advertisements will employ tracking pixels linked to Segment in our EBP website. Therefore from a marketing data
    standpoint we prefer you do not roll your own marketing materials.

    If there is a certain infographic you need, please describe or sketch it to us and we can discuss helping with
    creating it or possibly paying you to do it, but run it by us first.

4. **Promote the Global Competition/Hackathon**

    This is a an online competition with the event, rules and award categories announced in the second half of June 2018
    and the expected deadling is in mid-August 2018.


    As soon as reasonable we want to promote this event or at least mention it during our events, the prizes will be
    substantial and it's one of the singular goals EBP has together. Hopefully we can get as many developers from your
    community to join.



## Submit a Proposal

Your proposal will be reviewed by an admin and we may discuss changes if needed.

#### Your Proposal Must Have the Following Things

- your name and any assistants
- your background / resume and also those of your assistants
- expected hourly rate for all above
- primary tasks / goals, each with an hourly commitment and expected expenses
- a timeline of less than a month

*In the beginning we will not require quantitative goals since we have no data to estimate with, this will change
in the future.*

### Use this Template - keep it brief

[ELBP Task Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/119LOhOmt0sbp39S7mwvghHSb2D_Zf_zzFaW8e2dZF8w/edit?usp=sharing)


## Things to Avoid in the Meantime

#### Calling this program EBP

For now you simply represent Elastos, we are changing the name EBP to something else we haven't decided yet, but when
we do you will officially be part of that team.


#### Building a Standalone Website for Your Community

We hope every member that wishes to contribute joins the EBP website and our Slack channel. Nor do we want fragmented
communities in Elastos


#### Listing Research Time as Separate Tasks

We assume your personal learning, online research time and identifying schools/tech companies as assumed pre-requisites
for hosting a meetup or setting up meetings with influential blockchain individuals. Please include the hours expected
for this work in the total hours expected for a task.



## Payment

We will decide the payment on a case-by-case basis. We'll try to be as reasonable and as fair as possible to every organizer. For most situations, we'll pay half of your requested budget upfront and the rest upon completion however this is not ideal for all scenarios (eg. when the cost of organizing a meetup at a large venue is high and cannot be approximated beforehand).

Whatever the case may be, we'll request receipts for all the expenses for all the events and will reimburse everything while also being as fair as possible.

If you have leftover operating expenses, those need to be either returned to us,
or retained for future tasks by you. Please do not put your ELA address in the proposal. You need to send us your address via email.

If you have assistants we will send them their pay directly based on your instructions. Do not give your wallet's secret key for operating expenses to your assistants. As a organizer, you are responsible for the operating funds.
