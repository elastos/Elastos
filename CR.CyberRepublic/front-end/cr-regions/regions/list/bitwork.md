Operating out of Hong Kong, Bitwork is a blockchain community with a growing presence in the Pan Asian region. Bitwork hosts a coworking space where developers, teams, and general tech enthusiasts can collaborate, build projects, and explore blockchain’s ever-expanding use cases.

In addition to its coworking space, Bitwork provides nationally certified blockchain training courses and hosts regular events and activities focused on blockchain development and industry application.

Bitwork’s online and local activities alike have enabled its organization to connect with strong communities of developers, industry partners, and entrepreneurs that are well-versed in blockchain and eager to establish synergies with others. As a prominent CR Region, Bitwork affords Elastos opportunities to connect with professional and freelance developers in the blockchain space, as well as to increase developer and enterprise exposure at coordinated events and workshops. In recognition of its relationship, Bitwork is proudly running a Supernode to contribute to the Elastos blockchain’s DPoS Consensus.
