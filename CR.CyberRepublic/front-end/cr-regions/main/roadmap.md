# Growth Roadmap

All throughout Q1 Bitwork and Clarence will line up and review potential projects to immediately propose to CR after
the CR elections conclude. We believe that currently since Elastos has not done much marketing recently we must start
a minimum baseline of efforts to gather data. This initial data will establish some important baseline metrics to allow
us to estimate the ROI of each marketing dollar spent.

## Q2 Launch Marketing Initiatives - 3-Month Pilot

We have identified 3 partners to trial a 3-month pilot marketing project to establish baseline marketing data.

1. **Blockcast - SE Asia, Taiwan, China**

    This will likely be our most far reaching marketing effort, Blockcast is a close partner of Bitwork and has the
    ability to target multiple regions in SE Asia. Also being a bilingual firm, they will be able to spread news in both
    English and Chinese, which is a very strong advantage especially for Elastos.

2. **Block72 - Korea**

    A full global marketing firm based in New York, USA, their expertise and western marketing philosophy would be a good
    comparison to Blockcast. It's important to keep in mind that for the Q2 marketing pilot we must select a diverse
    set of marketing firms to have strong data.

3. **BlockLabs - Australia**

    Australia has an extremely strong community of blockchain developers due to the strong presence of Ethereum. Since
    this is a pilot project, we absolutely feel it is necessary to experiment and see how developer focused marketing
    will fare in this region. The ultimate goal in this region is to funnel developers into building dApps for the
    Elastos ecosystem.

## dApps Funding in Collaboration with the CR ETH Task Force and ElastOS Shanghai Team

Clarence is an advisor to the CR ETH Task Force and they have identified numerous dApps that could be built or ported
to Elastos from other blockchains. Of course software development is an expensive endeavor, therefore Bitwork will do
its best to connect developers with multiple sources of funding. The ability of Bitwork to use its extensive networks
to find alternative sources of funding will help alleviate the pressure on the CR Fund.

## Hackathons and Regular Meetups

Developers are a critical component of Elastos' growth and the best way we believe is to sponsor attractive hackathons
or meetups with prizes or bounties. We will work with all active and inactive CR Regions to jumpstart them again with
more stable funding, provide developer mentorship and organize events with other projects in our network.

## Exchange Strategy & Listing Campaign

Bitwork has extensive connections with exchanges and will leverage those to connect with exchanges that can work
within the strict rules of Cyber Republic - transparent listing fees, CR Proposal funding channels, genuine volume
 and community initiatives.

*It is important to note that many prominent exchange listing fees are exorbitant and nor does Bitwork have the legal
authority or lawyers to approach exchanges in more regulated regions such as the US, Japan and others. Therefore
