?> CR Regions are the primary vehicle to grow the Elastos ecosystem in the real world.

## Key Goals

### 1. Reach out and engage projects/businesses interested in exploring blockchain

Our CR Region Teams have full freedom to engage in marketing, business development and act independently
to do what they think will be best for the Elastos Ecosystem. Each team is actively encouraged
to go out and find more projects and do marketing to generate inbound leads.

### 2. Create strategies to adapt to each region

Through our CR Regions initiative we empower each regional team to create their own
strategies to spread the goals and ideals of Elastos and Cyber Republic.

We believe this will bring exponential growth to the Elastos ecosystem, we'll do this
through meetups, events, workshops, happy hours, media and more.

### 3. Engage in blockchain education, community development and cooperate with other blockchain projects

The goals of Elastos are a betterment to all, we believe in a future of data ownership, security and the right
to monetization and control our own data as we see fit.

However these goals are not ours alone and are shared by many projects in the blockchain space. Although our teams
cannot repurpose funds for non-Elastos related activities, they are free to cooperate with other projects. We believe
that through joint-meetups, co-sponsorship and participation in conferences and blockchain events is an effective
way to grow.

## Vote for our Global Fund Supernode!

### Hosted by&nbsp;[Clarence Liu - VP of Development](/main/clarence-about.md)

All funds from our CR Regions Global Fund supernode are used to fund our regional teams
and events that we believe will bring the most people to our community.

[All Budgets and Expenditures are fully transparent - you can view the log here](/supernodes/global-fund/budget.md)

Although our CR Region Teams receive funding from Cyber Republic, our goal is to transition
to be fully self-sufficient and self-funded. Therefore this and our other supernodes are
critical to our growth, if you have ELA follow this [voting guide](/main/voting-guide.md) to vote.
