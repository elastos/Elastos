We have identified 3 partners to trial a 3-month pilot marketing project to establish baseline marketing data. These
initial projects will be meant as trials because there is a huge lack of marketing data. After we collect and analyze
this data, we will be better able to refine our strategy for the rest of 2020 and beyond.

## 1. **Blockcast - SE Asia, Taiwan, China**

    This will likely be our most far reaching marketing effort, Blockcast is a close partner of Bitwork and has the
    ability to target multiple regions in SE Asia. Also being a bilingual firm, they will be able to spread news in both
    English and Chinese, which is a very strong advantage especially for Elastos.

## 2. **Block72 - Korea**

    A full global marketing firm based in New York, USA, their expertise and western marketing philosophy would be a good
    comparison to Blockcast. It's important to keep in mind that for the Q2 marketing pilot we must select a diverse
    set of marketing firms to have strong data.

## 3. **BlockLabs - Australia**

    Australia has an extremely strong community of blockchain developers due to the strong presence of Ethereum. Since
    this is a pilot project, we absolutely feel it is necessary to experiment and see how developer focused marketing
    will fare in this region. The ultimate goal in this region is to funnel developers into building dApps for the
    Elastos ecosystem.
