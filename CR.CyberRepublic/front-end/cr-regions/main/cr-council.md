## Creating a New Base of Operations for CR in Asia

The year 2020 will be a pivotal year where Elastos and Cyber Republic can grow exponentially with the launch of the
Cyber Republic Consensus project and a new CR Council of 12 elected representatives for the Elastos community.

To spur growth of Elastos, Cyber Republic, and blockchain technology in Asia and beyond, Clarence Liu from Elastos and
Bitwork will join forces to create a strong council committee, which focuses on driving the development and marketing of
cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain communities.

## Tokenomics - Addressing the Token Burn and Inflation Professionally

Our priority in addressing the potential Token Burn is two fold:

1. **Establish a Cryptocurrency Exchange Team** - we need experts to analyze the current volume, market sentiment and liquidity
of ELA on current exchanges. At the moment we have no data to predict the effect of any token burn or tokenomics changes, it is
imperative that we create a predictive model before we conduct any burn so that we may learn from our actions.

2. **Conduct a partial burn to test our data models** - we would agree to a burn but only if it is properly advised by experts.
Burning tokens in a vacuum with zero marketing or predictive models is a waste of time. Are there even investors or traders
waiting for an opportunity to buy ELA? Do investors even look at total market cap to base their decisions? These are 
fundamental questions we need to answer first. 


## The Council Committee

All three members will run as one CR Council candidate and draw on our extensive experience to collaborate and vote on
proposals.

### Andy Cheung - CEO of Bitwork, ex-COO of OKex Exchange

    Andy brings his vast experience from OKEx, Alibaba, Groupon HK, and many other startups to Bitwork. As the new CEO
    of Bitwork, he will use his extensive network to collaborate with Cyber Republic to accelerate projects throughout
    the region.

    first CR Regions and provided valuable business expertise, connections and community growth solutions to the Elastos
    ecosystem.

### Clarence Liu - VP Development of Elastos

    Being both a software engineer by training and the VP of Development for Elastos, Clarence has been the primary
    business development lead besides Feng Han, Co-Founder of Elastos. Since joining Elastos in May of 2018, he has
    attended dozens of conferences, hosted many meetups and done extensive networking throughout the blockchain industry.

## Founding Principles

Bitwork has first-hand experience working with the original CR Suggestion & Proposal process, along with Clarence, we
believe that even if we are decentralized, Elastos needs strong leadership to succeed in the competitive and fast-moving
blockchain space, especially in Asia. Together we believe we can bring strong business and blockchain acumen to Cyber
Republic and be a prominent force in the Elastos ecosystem.

### Active Business Development

Bitwork and Clarence already actively work in the blockchain business development space and will continually explore,
find and bring new projects to the Elastos ecosystem and Cyber Republic for potential funding, incubation and acceleration.

### Agile and Data-Driven Marketing

We believe in a dynamic and consistent marketing effort where our strategies are constantly examined based on real-data
feedback to allow us to achieve the greatest effect with minimal costs. We understand that the CR funds are a finite
resource and we must make smart decisions on marketing. Real growth will only be achieved if we can exponentially grow
the community and exposure of Elastos.

### Proper Balance of Funding and Liquidity

The selling pressure caused by CRC will undoubtedly be a major concern. With our business experience and technical know
how, we will closely monitor the market and projects to ensure additional sources of liquidity or demand accompany any
expenditures.
