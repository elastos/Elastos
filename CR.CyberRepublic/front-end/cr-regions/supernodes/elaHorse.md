Run by our esteemed CR Malaysia Task Force member KK - Telegram: @elaHorse, this supernode supports a
mission to grow the ElastOS ecosystem in Malaysia. One of their main accomplishments of 2019 was bringing on our
partner Dacsee which we have two ongoing projects with.

    "We are excited with the progress, surely we can gain more traction in the coming future."
