##### Elastos DPoS Supernode - see us at&nbsp;<https://elanodes.com>

**All funds from our CR Regions Global Fund supernode are used to fund our regional teams
and events that we believe will bring the most people to our community.**

### To learn how to vote see the&nbsp;[voting guide](/main/voting-guide.md)

Our stake is graciously sponsored by Feng Han and the Manhattan Fund therefore we will update
our funding periodically, eventually if we have enough ELA we will host it ourselves.

### All funds from the CR Regions Supernode are dedicated to supporting CR Region Teams
