# CR Regions - Support Team

Each CR Regional Team varies in experience, backgrounds and size, for example some regions may have more technical
members and other regions have none. Marketing and business development expertise is also expected from each region
however the reality is that this varies significantly right now until we find more balanced team members.

Therefore it's fundamental that we provide a pool of experts and support for the newer teams so that they can function
their best. We also want each team to feel like they are not alone and have a reliable team to count on.

#### The Support Team is made up of actual Elastos employees, leaders of CR projects and also special Task Forces
