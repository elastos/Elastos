            <h3>1. PURPOSE, USE AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h3>

            <p>
                            The vision for Cyber Republic starts with an ambitious idea: create a self-running and self-governed community of entrepreneurs and developers who can function independently of Elastos but with the unified goal to grow it into a global success. With that vision in mind, Cyber Republic may use your personal information to find the right entrepreneurs and developers for certain tasks and projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                            In addition to our main vision statement, we may use your personal information, sometimes combined with non-personal information, in the following ways:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>To identify you when you visit our website.</li>
              <li>To provide the products, information, and services you request.</li>
              <li>To improve and personalize your experience with us, including creating certain tasks specifically based on your experience and knowledge on a certain subject matter.</li>
