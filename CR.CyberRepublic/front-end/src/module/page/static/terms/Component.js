                <b>DISPUTES.</b>
                {' '}
Except as otherwise provided below, the parties will attempt to resolve all disputes,
                controversies, or claims arising under, out of, or relating to these Terms of Use, including the
                formation, validity, binding effect, interpretation, performance, breach or termination, of these Terms
                of Use and the arbitrability of the issues submitted to arbitration hereunder and non-contractual claims
                relating to these Terms of Use (each, a "Dispute"), in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
                Section. If any Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations between the parties within five days of
                notice from one party to the other of the Dispute, such Dispute will be finally settled through binding
                arbitration under the arbitration of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) then in
                effect (the "Rules"). Either party may commence the arbitration by delivering a request for arbitration
                as specified in the Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before a sole neutral arbitrator selected
                by agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of a single arbitrator
                within 30 days (the "Initial Period") after either party delivers a request for arbitration, a neutral
                arbitrator will be selected as provided in the Rules. The arbitration will be conducted exclusively in
                the English language at a site specified by Elastos in Singapore. The award of the arbitrator will be
                the exclusive remedy of the parties for all claims, counterclaims, issues or accountings presented or
                plead to the arbitrator. The award of the arbitrators will require payment of the costs, fees, and
                expenses incurred by the prevailing party in any such arbitration by the non-prevailing party. Judgment
                upon the award may be entered in any court or governmental body having jurisdiction thereof. Any
                additional costs, fees, or expenses incurred in enforcing the award may be charged against the party
                that resists its enforcement.

The interpretation of the rights and obligations of the parties under
                these Terms of Use, including, to the extent applicable, any negotiations, arbitrations or other
                proceedings hereunder, will be governed in all respects exclusively by the laws of Singapore, as such
                laws apply to contracts between residents of Singapore without regard to conflict of laws provisions
                thereof. Subject to Section 14 (Disputes), each party will bring any action or proceeding arising from
                or relating to these Terms of Use exclusively in a court in Singapore, and You irrevocably submit to the
                personal jurisdiction and venue of any such courts in any such action or proceeding brought in such
                courts by Elastos.

                agreement between the parties, and supersedes any oral or written proposal, agreement or other
                communication between the parties, regarding Your access to and use of the Website and Content. Except
                as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use may be amended or modified only by a
                writing signed by both parties. All waivers by Elastos under these Terms of Use must be in writing or
                later acknowledged by Elastos in writing. Any waiver or failure by Elastos to enforce any provision of
                these Terms of Use on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver by Elastos of any other provision or of
                such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be
                unenforceable, that provision will be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law, replaced
                by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to
                the extent consistent with the law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. Neither
                these Terms of Use nor any rights or obligations of You hereunder may be assigned or transferred by You
                (in whole or in part and including by sale, merger, consolidation, or other operation of law) without
                the prior written approval of Elastos. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and
