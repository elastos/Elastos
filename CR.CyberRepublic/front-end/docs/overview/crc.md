# CRC Workflow

At the moment this is the only process to get projects and ideas funded in Cyber Republic. Everyone including the CR Council members
are required to go through this transparent process in order to allocate Cyber Republic's funds to anything.

?> Note: this is still an **ALPHA** version of the **CRC workflow**

## Example of a Suggestion to Execution Lifecycle {docsify-ignore}


### 1. A member of the public creates a Suggestion on the Cyber Republic website

Anyone with an account on Cyber Republic can create a **Suggestion**. In the future we will tie accounts to wallets and add a reputation system
to ensure a high quality of submissions. [Cyber Republic Website - Suggestions Page](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion)


### 2. The public votes on the Suggestion and it becomes popular

If the Suggestion gains enough popularity, a member of the CR Council will evaluate the Suggestion and provide feedback in the comments or create a Proposal.

However if the Suggestion does not gain enough popularity or there is good constructive feedback, the creator can create a new updated Suggestion after a
reasonable period of time.

!> Please Note: CR Council members are not required to create Proposals for every popular **Suggestion**, but we will encourage them to provide feedback as to why they are being passed.

If council members are not giving proper feedback, as a last resort there is a impeachment process to remove them.


### 3. A council member takes the Suggestion and creates a Proposal

The council is expected to consist of a variety of people from all walks of life and specializations. We also don't assume they are well versed in every important area required
to properly assess a project's merits. Therefore we expect that council members rely on the resources in the Secretariat Team and its expert advisers to create a formal **Proposal**.

**Council members will be given specific guidelines, such as:**

- A formal Proposal should include estimates of funding required, expected equity in a project and return on investment (ROI)
- Larger projects should have set milestones to allow the teams to prove their abilities and minimize the risk to Cyber Republic
- If a specific team/person is proposed, all person(s) must have their backgrounds and resumes checked as part of a required due diligence process

By creating a Proposal a council member must sign and accept responsibility for that Proposal, it is expected that their record
will be up for scrutiny in future elections.


### 4. The finalized Proposal is brought up for voting

**Proposals** must be made public at [https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals) so the public can view the full proposal and all its details.

!> There is a 7 day voting period for Council members, the votes are also public and must pass by majority.


### 5. If the Council votes YES the Proposal will be translated to the pertinent languages

This translation is done as a preparation step to allow the community to fully understand the proposal.

?> **24 hours minimum** - will be allocated for the translation process **and the time and date for the community rejection voting period will be announced.**
This also gives time for the community to be notified of the Proposal.

Initially the main languages that each passing Proposal will be translated to are only English and Chinese.


### 6. The public community has a chance to reject the Proposal over 3 days

The voting period for the public is 3 days. The final threshold to reject a proposal has not yet been decided.

It's expected that if the community is happy with the proposal that they simply abstain from voting.


### 7. The passed Proposal is assigned a Team to execute it

There are two possibilities here, a Proposal can either:

1. Be already assigned to a specific team, organization or person to execute
2. Require a Tender/Bid process to find a suitable team/person to execute

If there is already someone assigned to execute the Proposal, then the CRC workflow is complete and the project will commence.

Otherwise the Secretariat will create a **Tender** and use their own resources to find a suitable team to execute the Proposal.
The community will also be engaged to see if they can refer capable teams or persons. This will be a bidding process where bids and
team backgrounds will be evaluated by the Secretariat Team and the best candidate chosen.

?> Obviously the Secretariat Team and its experts will not simply choose the lowest bid, but look at all aspects of the team/person and evaluate their ability to execute the Proposal.

The team/person chosen by the Secretariat Team will also go through the same process as a Proposal, with a Council voting period and a
chance at community rejection. The voting periods may be shortened from 7 and 3 days respectively, this will be further decided soon.

This tender/bid process will repeat until a suitable team/person is found and accepted by both the Council and community.
