# Welcome to the Cyber Republic Documentation {docsify-ignore-all}

!> Disclaimer: These are draft documents only, the official CRC whitepaper will be released shortly

### Cyber Republic's (CR) goal is to allow the public to control how CR's funds are spent and used, currently this is only through the Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC) Workflow.

__All Suggestions, Proposals, Decisions and Financials are public__, CR will strive to be fully transparent and a tool to serve the general public.

!> **There is only one way that ELA is spent** and that is through the [Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC) Workflow](/overview/crc.md)

#### The Constitution & CRC Document

1. The Constitution listed here and on the cyberrepublic.org website is a work in progress ALPHA

2. There will be a CRC document released when key issues are solved and finalized

##### The CRC was created as a way for the community to propose and vote on ideas or projects that better the Elastos Ecosystem.

?> However it's fundamental that the voice of majority is heard, not the loudest individuals, we implore everyone to vote on Suggestions and discuss what they feel CR should invest in on the [CR forums](https://forum.cyberrepublic.org)

#### Ideal projects include, but are not limited to:

- **Ecosystem Development Projects** - building reusable open-source components so that developers can more easily build dApps on Elastos

- **Marketing Initiatives, Regional Events and Meetups** - are there specific channels you think Elastos should market to? Or is there a region that would be receptive to Elastos? These are all valid suggestions, nor do you need to propose who will execute the proposal, its the Secretariat team's job to find a competent team to do the Proposal.

- **dApp projects** - in case you have an idea for the first killer dApp, all ideas are welcome even if you're not a developer

- **Media** - do you think a certain infographic or video needs to be made? We are making these all the time but as a community you can promote to use funds to focus on certain areas as well
