3. Every year, an additional 4% of the initial 33,000,000 ELA coins will be created, to ensure a healthy rate of coin supply inflation, incentivize network support, and to fund Cyber Republic projects. Of these additional coins, 30% will be given to the Cyber Republic Council as additional assets to manage in developing the Elastos Ecosystem.
