# Proposals

Proposals can only be created by the Council members or Secretariat, typically they are created based off the community added **Suggestions**,
but they can also be created by these members directly.

All proposals must be public and can be found at: [Cyber Republic Website - Proposals Page](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals).

**Some key points about Proposals:**

1. A proposal may designate a person, team or organization to execute it. If so this bypasses the tender/bidding process.

2. A proposal must both pass a majority vote by the council and an opportunity for the community to reject it.

3. If the proposal requires funding, a detailed analysis of ROI must be included.


#### A Proposal will always have a primary council member that is required to accept responsibility for the execution and performance of the project.
