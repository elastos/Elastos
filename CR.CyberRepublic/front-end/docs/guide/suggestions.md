# Suggestions

CR Suggestions are a key feature of the CRC workflow described [here](/overview/crc.md).

Anyone with an account can create a Suggestion at [Cyber Republic Website - Suggestions Page](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion).

In the future we will tie accounts to wallets and add a reputation system to ensure a high quality of submissions.

!> Spamming, creating fake accounts for upvoting and inappropriate content will not be tolerated.


#### Post your idea on the forums first!

This is a highly suggested way to gather feedback on your idea before publishing it as a Suggestion.

You can find the forums here: [https://forum.cyberrepublic.org](https://forum.cyberrepublic.org)
