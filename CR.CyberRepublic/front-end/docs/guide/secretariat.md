# The Secretariat Team

The Secretariat Team is the administrative team behind the CRC and Council.

This team will have a basic hierarchy with the Secretariat as its leader who will be responsible for the smooth operations of CR.

There is no set composition or size for this team, but it will likely consist of a mix of full-time and part-time
advisers in various fields and it will scale in size as needed.

*A webpage is in the works now to list the Secretariat and the team*
