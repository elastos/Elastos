#### How much funding is available?

As written in the Cyber Republic Constitution, each year the council has discretion to spend 10% of the remaining ELA allocated to Cyber Republic.
At the start CR had a bit over 16 million ELA, so 10% of this is ~1.6 million ELA, there is no requirement to spend all of it. We absolutely advocate spending the funds wisely.

Currently the funds are held at: [https://blockchain.elastos.org/address/8KNrJAyF4M67HT5tma7ZE4Rx9N9YzaUbtM](https://blockchain.elastos.org/address/8KNrJAyF4M67HT5tma7ZE4Rx9N9YzaUbtM)

*All spending that occurs in Cyber Republic must be transparent and we will be providing a list of pertinent wallet addresses.*

#### Is the funding given all at once or based on milestones?

There is no explicit rule but the Secretariat Team will consist of various experts in their own field, especially investment. In that sense
it can be assumed that everything will be done to minimize the risk to Elastos, including attaching funding to certain milestones and deliverables.

If this isn't being upheld the community can always vote on an amendment to the constitution to be changed, however as noted elsewhere we
want to keep CRC as simple as possible and avoid becoming as bureaucratic and inefficient as our existing government systems.

#### How does the Council ensure that the funds are spent properly?

The auditing process is not finalized, but since the Secretariat Team will include experienced accountants and investors we expect professionally written
requirements. Financial reporting should be expected as well as due diligence to verify the milestones and deliverables are as reported before milestone based funding is given.

Multi-signature wallets will also be setup so that the Council can revoke or hold funds until the milestones are met.

#### When till the Council start selecting Suggestions and adding Proposals?

Right now the interim CR Council has discretion to create proposals and spend approx. 1 million of ELA from the Elastos Foundation private mining rewards.

It is very important to us to instill trust in the members of Elastos, the Secretariat Team and interim council, so it is not expected that much of the 1 million ELA will
be spent by the interim council.

The interim council was not elected by the community, and so they have opted to be reliant on the popularity of Suggestions to make decisions, rather than risk wrongly assuming
the will of the community. At the moment the lines of communication between the community and interim council are simply not set up, but we hope to improve this
heading into Q2 of 2019.
