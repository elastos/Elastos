#### Can I be the one that also does the Suggestion if it's approved?

Yes if you would like to do the project yourself or have a team or person in mind you can add that to your suggestion. This is completely optional too and you're just as welcome
to add an idea and leave it up to the Secretariat Team to find a person/team suitable to execute the idea properly.

!> **Please Note:** it is at the Council and Secretariat Team's discretion to choose whoever eventually get assigned the task. But the reasons will be transparent and in the case of a tender/bid process it will also be visible.


#### Can I edit a Suggestion?

At the moment we do not allow edits, if your idea has received good feedback you can resubmit your Suggestion again after a reasonable amount of time with your revisions or improved ideas.


#### Can the CRC Workflow be changed?

Absolutely, we don't claim to get everything right the first time. Suggestions to improve the CRC Workflow are welcome,
the Council also has the power to bypass the Suggestion process and propose their own improvements to the CRC Workflow.
We are always looking for ways to improve the workflow, make it more efficient and create better checks and balances.

?> However we do want to learn from lessons from the real world, adding too many rules decreases efficiency. The last thing we want is the CRC workflow to become as bureaucratic as the current governments we wish to improve upon.

#### What's the dPoS Consensus and is it related to CR Consensus?

The DPoS Consensus is an Elastos consensus mechanism where any ELA holders can vote for 96 of the 108 DPoS supernodes, this operates independently from Cyber Republic.
however **the 7 elected CR Council members also control 7 of the 12 non-rotating dPoS elected nodes**.
