# What can you build on Elastos?

### <span style="color: #4585C4;">Anything!</span>

Any web app or mobile app, Elastos is just like any other cloud platform like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud, but it’s decentralized. Imagine building a typical website like Airbnb or a mobile app like Lyft but anyone can take the source code and create their own network or “fork”.

The hidden caveat here is that any profits or fees added for middlemen, infrastructure or services can be modified and minimized. Not happy with what the new “decentralized Airbnb” is charging for fees? Just fork it, setup your own network and change the fees, but make sure you realize that providing customer support, SLAs and operations are more expensive than you might think.

Done correctly however business models become a type of commodity, granted trust takes time to build, but even trust can be encoded onto the blockchain and tracked on an individual level. In this new paradigm users and providers can maximize their gains and middlemen without value add can be removed.

?> What open-source did for software, blockchain and decentralization will do for entire internet businesses.
