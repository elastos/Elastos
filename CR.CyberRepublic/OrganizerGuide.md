# EBP (To Be Renamed) - Organizer Guide

As an organizer you can create events and tasks for members or yourself to do.

**Please Note: The ELA rewards are for each applicant**


## To create a task for yourself

You can create a task from the Community page or your `Profile -> Tasks` page

Then check the box next to Assign to Self, and ensure that

After creation you can see the task as PENDING, an admin will receipt an email to review
your task/event proposal and the requested ELA reward

After an admin approves the task, you will get an email and after that your task will have
the status ASSIGNED - with you as the assignee

When you are done you can click the **"Accept as Complete"** button, and then the admin
will receive a notification to review and distribute the ELA

## To create a task for others

The process is the same, but do not check the box for Assign to Self

You will also now need to set a number of candidates allowed

- Candidates = the max number of members that can apply to be considered

- Max Accepted = the max number of applicants that are accepted, please note each applicant that is accepted can receive the full ELA Upfront/Reward amount

An admin will still approve the task, until then it will be a **PENDING** task.

After approval however you will see a different status: **APPROVED** at this point the task/event
is shown in the public Community Page for all members

At this point all members can apply - see [Members Guide](./MembersGuide.md) for more info

Once you have applicants you as an organizer are required to review and accept up to the maximum number
of applicants you entered when you created the task.

You can review the applicants from your `Profile -> Tasks -> select the task` detail page.

![home-page](http://d72wx65dsgs48.cloudfront.net/images/MD/14.png)

Clicking the user's name will show a modal that allows you to accept that applicant. At anytime
as long as you have at least applicant you can also click **Force Start** to start the task or
the task will automatically be ACTIVE once the max number of applicants is reached.

After this the task becomes active for all applicants they will individually have a **"Submit as Complete"** button.

After the users submit the task, you will need to click **"Accept as Complete"** at which point it will
go to an admin to review.
