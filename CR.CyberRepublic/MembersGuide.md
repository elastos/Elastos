# EBP (To Be Renamed) - Members Guide

As a member you can only apply to help organizers or take on bounties,
either developer or community based bounties.

## Developers

If you are a developer or aspiring engineer you are free to join any events or apply for tasks
in the developer page.

### Events

Unlike Community Events where organizers are looking for help to organize an event, the events and
training sessions listed under Developer Events are for members/developers to register to attend the events.

After reviewing a Developer Event simply click "Join Event" under Registrants to join the event

### Tasks

Anyone may apply to take on developer tasks but since there is a selection/acceptance process only a certain number
of applicants will be allowed for each task. After you apply for a task you must wait for the
admin/owner to either contact you or accept you.

Please enter a message to the owner stating your qualifications

You may also click the organizer's name and send them an email to start an email conversation regarding
your interest.

Once the owner of the task reviews your application you will receive an email regarding their decision.

If you are accepted you should now be able to see the task under `Profile -> Tasks -> Active Tasks`:

The status of the task should be ASSIGNED - this means the task is active and you are free to start working on it.

As you make progress please give regular updates via the comments thread on this task.

It is important you start an email conversation with the owner at this point, deliverables if any
should be emailed directly to the owner of the task.

*(Comments thread feature will be ready on June 13)*

When you are done the task click the **"Submit as Complete"** button (the image is out of date)

You should now see that the status is SUBMITTED

The owner of the task will receive an email, review the task and can decide to either approve it
or send it back to you for changes. They will be in contact with you via email.
