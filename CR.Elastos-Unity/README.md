## Introduction

Elastos Unity is a React Native framework to allow developers to add the Elastos Wallet and Carrier functionnalities to their mobile apps. The main goal of the Elastos Unity project is to create the required bridges to access native wallet and carrier libaries directly from JavaScript without dealing with any native programming languages. The Elastos Unity project is organized in several GitHub repositories as indicated below:

* [elastos-unity-carrier](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-carrier): original repository of the Elastos Unity Carrier package. The package is also available on npmjs and can be installed using the npm or yarn commands.
* [elastos-unity-carrier-demo](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-carrier-demo): a demo app using the elastos-unity-carrier package
* [elastos-unity-carrier-doc](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-carrier): the documentation repository for the elastos-unity-carrier package. A formatted version of the documentation is available at [http://elastosunity.com/docs/carrier](http://elastosunity.com/docs/carrier/#introduction)
* [elastos-unity-wallet](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-wallet): original repository of the Elastos Unity Wallet package. The package is also available on npmjs and can be installed using the npm or yarn commands.
* [elastos-unity-wallet-demo](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-wallet-demo): a demo app using the elastos-unity-wallet package
* [elastos-unity-wallet-doc](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-wallet-doc): the documentation repository for the elastos-unity-wallet package. A formatted version of the documentation is available at [http://elastosunity.com/docs/wallet](http://elastosunity.com/docs/wallet/#introduction)
* [elastos-unity-cli](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-cli): a command line interface tool to help developers create a boilerplate React Native app with the Wallet and/or Carrier packages already installed. In addition, a list of placeholder images (Elastos and Elastos Unity) are included in the app to let developers start building their app quickly.
* [elastos-unity-website](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-unity-website): the code for the website hosted at elastosunity.com
