The address on Elastos ETH Sidechain is completely compatible with Ethereum mainnet's address, this means you could use 
your existing Ethereum address on Elastos ETH Sidechain (however there obviously wouldn't be any ETH in it). 

If you don't have an address yet we also provide a simple way to create one:

Click [ELA ETH web wallet](https://wallet.elaeth.io/) then **New Wallet** tab, then follow the guide on the website and 
you should can create a new ELA ETH address. **DO NOT forget to backup your keystore file and password.**
