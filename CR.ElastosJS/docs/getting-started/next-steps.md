#### Try a Few Tutorials

If you're new to blockchain development you can try our [tutorials](tutorial/index.md), however if you're just
developing smart contracts then any Ethereum based tutorials also apply.

Here's a few great resources to learn about Ethereum

- [OpenZepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin/index.html) - has a bunch of great documentation and Smart
Contract templates that are battle-tested and contain many of the best practices for Solidity development.

- [BitDegree](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/solidity) - has some good tutorials to follow


**Remember that the only change you need to make to run these tutorials on Elastos ETH Sidechain is that you need to change
the RPC port to https://rpc.elaeth.io**
