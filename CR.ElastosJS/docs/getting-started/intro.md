This guide takes you through the steps to get connected to the Ethereum **testnet** and setup a
wallet with some ELA ETH in it.

##### This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of web development, both front-end and back-end

If you're a web developer it's recommended to do some preliminary reading on blockchains, here's some primary 
differences to be aware of:

1. **Interacting with a blockchain requires tokens**, therefore during development you will typically be on the
**testnet**. You can get free tokens ([https://faucet.elaeth.io](http://faucet.elaeth.io)) that have no value for development and testing, then when you are ready
you can deploy to the **mainnet** which uses tokens of real value.    

2. **Smart contracts cannot be deleted because blockchains are immutable** (theoretically and ignoring fork situations) 
therefore you must be extremely careful about deploying them. A good analogy is that blockchain development is like
writing code for rockets/satellites, once the smart contract is launched it becomes much harder to make changes. However
more advanced topics such as **proxiable** smart contracts later will introduce ways to mitigate this.

### IMPORTANT: The Elastos ETH Sidechain is completely separate from the real Ethereum blockchain.

Any ETH, tokens (ERC20/721/more...) or Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network are not connected to the Elastos ETH Sidechain and vice versa.
