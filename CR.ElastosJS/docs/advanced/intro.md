If you're already a seasoned blockchain developer we assume you've at least had some basic experience with Ethereum and
Solidity, regardless of what blockchain platform you ended up building upon.

This is a modified EVM therefore development is generally the same, our goal is to provide the same primary tools
used for Ethereum development and minimize the differences.
