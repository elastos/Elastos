title: Funding for DApps
sidebar_label: Funding for DApps
---

Our DAO named **Cyber Republic (CR)** is always looking for new DApps, blockchain projects and marketing initiatives that would 
benefit the Elastos ecosystem, there is no requirement to be exclusive to Elastos. 

**The only real requirement is to prove to the community that your DApp will bring a positive benefit to our ecosystem.** 

Our Elastos Ethereum Sidechain is compatible with existing Ethereum DApps, but even if you don't have a DApp there are many ways
we can collaborate.

#### Cyber Republic will fund things like:

- Marketing or joint-promotional initiatives

- Pilot projects for traditional businesses to explore blockchain

- Community building and public education of blockchain

- Developer teams with startup project ideas

- Existing startups that need funding for their DApps

- **And anything else you think will benefit the blockchain community, especially Elastos**


## Getting Funding

#### 1. Reach out to the ETH Task Force Team advisor at clarence@elastos.org and discuss your idea

Not sure if your idea qualifies for funding or looking for someone to bounce ideas off of? Clarence Liu 
the Elastos VP of Development is happy to discuss your idea and provide feedback before you create the proposal. 


#### 2. Create a Cyber Republic Suggestion at [www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion) to raise your idea to the community

An official **CR Suggestion** is the first step in the Cyber Republic Consensus process, the **"Suggestion"** is a detailed
initial proposal created on our official website at www.cyberrepublic.org. **It is voted upon by the community and the 
CR Council** and must clearly define the Goals, Motivation, Implementation Plan and Budget. 

Therefore we hope you reach out to us first and discuss your project, so we can help you craft the best **Suggestion** 
possible to pitch your project to the community.


#### 3. Wait for feedback or contact a CR Council member listed at [www.cyberrepublic.org/council](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/council)

After creating your Suggestion the interim council gauges the community feedback via the likes and dislikes received by
your Suggestion. If your Suggestion is viewed positively by the community or the council member thinks your project
stands out they will convert your Suggestion into a **[Proposal](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals)**.


#### 4. Wait 7 days for your proposal to be voted on by the council

Once your Suggestion has been converted into a **Proposal** all the members of the council will vote on it. If the 
majority approves the Proposal, after the 7 day period is over the CR Secretariat Team will contact you to discuss
the next steps, sign an agreement (non-legally binding) and arrange funding.

If your Proposal is rejected do not be dismayed, discuss with the council members on why they voted the way they did
and re-submit your Suggestion again with the improvements.
