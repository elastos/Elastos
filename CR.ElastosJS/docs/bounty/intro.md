**Have an existing DApp?** We would love to discuss potential funding opportunities for you to port your application or build
a proof of concept on the Elastos ETH Sidechain. 

### The Elastos ETH Sidechain is 100% Compatible with Ethereum DApps

We use the same EVM process with a modified consensus model, but beyond that your existing DApps should work as they
normally would on the real Ethereum blockchain. 

### Why Port Your Application?

**1. Faster DPoS Based Blockchain, Larger Block Gas Limit** - The votes for our DPoS validator pool (Supernodes) are rooted in the Elastos Mainchain which is merge mined with Bitcoin.
We have already reached 45%+ of Bitcoin's hashrate which puts our cost to attack at over 400k USD/hour, over 3x that of
Ethereum. 

**2. Lower Gas Fees** - Our blockchain doesn't rely on PoW so fundamentally we require less gas. At the expected block has limit of 8,700,000,000 
we intuitively do not need a high gas price to reasonably compensate our DPoS nodes.  

**3. Grant Funding Available** - Our DAO named Cyber Republic (CR) has over 16 million ELA tokens that are distributed
via a grant process to promising projects. You can find out more at [Funding for DApps](bounty/funding.md).
 

### To test your DApp connect it to our TestNet at http://rpc.elaeth.io.
