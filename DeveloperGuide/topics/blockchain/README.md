## Elastos Blockchain

One of the highlights of the design is that it makes use of a blend of mainchains and sidechains to improve the computational ability of blockchain technology. The mainchain only executes simple transactions and payment transfers while the sidechain handles smart contracts to support services and applications. With this, structure scalability and security can be accomplished.

Similar to the Operating System on a mobile device, users need a trustworthy location to store important data. The Elastos blockchain works as this trust zone for the entire network Operating System. The Elastos blockchain applies main and sidechain solutions to facilitate the smart economy and a healthy decentralized application environment. This means that every application can create individual sidechains. The Elastos blockchain provides built-in, complete, easy-to-use sidechain support. They will also be customizable, allowing clients to pick a different consensus method depending on the use case.
