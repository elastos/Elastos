## Usage

**CMake** is used to build, test and package the Elastos Carrier project in an operating system as well as compiler-independent manner.

Certain knowledge of CMake is required.

At the time of this writing, The compilation of sources works on **macOS**, **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian etc.) and **Windows**, and provides the option to cross-compile for target systems of **iOS**, **Android** and **RaspberryPi**.

## Build on Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Host

### 1. Brief introduction

On Ubuntu / Debian / Linux, besides the compilation for the host itself, cross-compilation is possible for the following targets:

- Android with architectures of **armv7a**, **arm64** and simulators of **x86/x86_64** are supported.
- RaspberryPi with architecture **armv7l** only.

### 2. Install Pre-Requirements

To generate Makefiles by using **configure** or **cmake** and manage dependencies of the Carrier project, certain packages must be installed on the host before compilation.

Run the following commands to install the prerequisite utilities:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -f build-essential autoconf automake autopoint libtool flex bison libncurses5-dev cmake
```

Download this repository using Git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK
```

### 3. Build to run on host (Ubuntu / Debian / Linux)

To compile the project from source code for the target to run on Ubuntu / Debian / Linux, carry out the following steps:

Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the previously downloaded folder that contains the source code of the Carrier project.

```shell
cd YOUR-PATH/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK
```

Enter the 'build' folder.

```shell
cd build
```

Create a new folder with the target platform name, then change directory.

```shell
mkdir linux
cd linux
```

Generate the Makefile in the current directory:

*Note: Please see custom options below.*

```shell
cmake ../..
```

***

Optional (Generate the Makefile): To be able to build a distribution with a specific build type **Debug/Release**, as well as with customized install location of distributions, run the following commands:

```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=YOUR-INSTALL-PATH ../..
```

***

Build the program:

*Note: If "make" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make" instead.*

```shell
make
```

Install the program:

*Note: If "make install" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make install" instead.*

```shell
make install
```

Create distribution package:

*Note: If "make dist" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make dist" instead.*

```shell
make dist
```

### 4. Run Elashell or Elatests

Elashell is a fully functional, lightweight shell program that processes commands and returns the output to the terminal. Through Elashell, users may connect to other carrier nodes and exchange messages.

Elatests is also a shell program, but with predefined commands, therefore no user interaction is necessary. The output for every command is displayed in the terminal for a simple evaluation of test results.

To run elashell or elatests, first extract the distribution package created previously and enter the extracted folder. Then, change directory to the 'bin' folder.

```shell
cd YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-PACKAGE-PATH/bin
```

Run Elashell:

```shell
./elashell
```

Available commands in the shell can be listed by using the command **help**. Specific command usage descriptions can be displayed by using **help [Command]** where [Command] must be replaced with the specific command name. For the entire command list please see the [COMMANDS.md](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK/blob/master/COMMANDS.md) file.

sudo apt-get install doxygen python-sphinx graphviz
curl -L -o /tmp/get-pip.py https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python /tmp/get-pip.py
sudo pip install breathe
```

#### 2. Build

Change to the directory where the build for any target has been previously executed. For example, if the target was Linux, the folder structure would be similar to:

```shell
cd /YOUR-PATH/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK/build/linux
```

Run the following command:

*Note: If "make" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make" instead.*

```shell
cmake -DENABLE_DOCS=ON ../..
