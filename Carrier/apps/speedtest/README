Arguments to the following two options are mandatory in order to use the program:

-c configuration file

-f file to transfer or be saved as

Additionally, if you want to friend someone, just provide his address through the -a option.

If the -a option is not used, the argument to the -f option is the file to tranfer.
Otherwise, it's the file to be saved as.

speedtest.sh is an incomplete shell script template to start the program, give it the argument to the -f option and it will run smoothly.
