// is required to offset a LES message id (away from the P2P id space).

// module *absolutely does not* depend on anything...  So we'll use this 'MessageCoder' abstraction
// to bundle all the LES specific needs.

    // ÐΞVp2p messages) and given to each shared (equal-version, equal name) sub-protocol in
    // alphabetic order. Sub-protocols that are not shared are ignored. If multiple versions are
